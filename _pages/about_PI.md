<p> I develop innovative medical robotic systems by studying the fundamental physical principles of novel robotic actuation and sensing methods to create next generation healthcare solutions and works on the integration of medical imaging, robotic autonomy and artificial intelligence into medical robotic systems. My research focuses on the development of novel magnetic medical micro and flexible robot designs operating under ultra-high magnetic fields, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging based robot tracking methods and innovative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based magnetic positioning systems. </p>

<p>I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering (15) and Physics (16) from METU Ankara and received my Master's degree in Robotics (18) from ETH Zurich. Later, I completed my Doctoral studies at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and ETH Zurich (23) and continued my research in Max Planck Institute as Postdoctoral researcher (25).</p>
