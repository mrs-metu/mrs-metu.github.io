<p>I develop medical image-guided robotic platforms by exploring the physical principles of novel sensing methods and robotic actuation concepts and integrating control, perception, and intelligence for medical robotic autonomy. My research focuses on magnetically actuated autonomous minimally invasive medical continuum and micro-robotic systems and combining these robotic systems with medical imaging and sensing systems operating at ultrahigh magnetic fields, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) magnetic sensing systems. </p>

<p>I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering (15) and Physics (16) from METU Ankara and received my Master's degree in Robotics from ETH Zurich. Later, I  completed my Doctoral studies at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and ETH Zurich.</p>
