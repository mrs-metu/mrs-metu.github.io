<p> Successful applicants will work on interdisciplinary research projects spanning various exciting fields, including: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Magnetism and Magnetic actuation </li>
	<li> Continuum mechanics </li>
	<li> Electromagnetic actuation systems </li>
 	<li> Mechatronic design </li>
	<li> Nonlinear control </li>
</ul>  

<h4> Education & Experience </h4> 

<p>Applicant should have</p>

<ul>
	<li> have high motivation </li>
	<li> have good oral and written communication skills in English. </li>
	<li> be able to work on-site at METU Ankara</li>
</ul>  

<p> Applicant should have experience/knowledge in following areas </p>

<ul>
	<li> mechatronics (integrated hardware and software system) </li>
	<li> CAD designing </li>
	<li> Programming (C++, Python, ROS) </li>
	<li> Embedded systems </li>
	<li> Control theory (optional)</li>
	<li> Magnetism (optional)</li>
</ul>
